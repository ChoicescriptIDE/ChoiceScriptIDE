## FAQ

### Why can't you delete projects from within CSIDE?
CSIDE doesn't use physical project files. Rather it creates and stores project information on the fly, with data derived from your files. The closest we could get to allowing deletion of a project is the deletion of a folder, which is a very dangerous thing to allow from within the application.

### Can I use CSIDE alongside application x, y and/or z?
Of course! CSIDE in practice, as far as file editing is concerned at least, is nothing more than another snazzy text editor. You can use it as much or as little as you like, by itself or in conjuction with any other application you might fancy.
