## Publishing & Exporting


Ready to publish or export your project? Choice of Games LLC handles the actual publishing and selling of ChoiceScript games, and you can learn more about that [here](https://www.choiceofgames.com/looking-for-writers/ "Choice of Games - Looking for Writers"). If you're looking for a way to get your project running outside of CSIDE for public beta testing purposes, read on!


### Exporting as Compiled Game

A compiled game is a single .html file; clicking it will run your game in a web browser tab. To compile your game, right-click the project header bar and select 'Export: Compiled Game'. You will be prompted to select a save location for your compiled file, either in an existing folder or by creating a new one.

Compiled games can be hosted online on a private web server, like any other website, or via Dashingdon for beta testing purposes(see below for details).

Note: If you wish to include images within your compiled game, please see the topic on [Image Scenes](topics/image-scenes.md " Image Scenes").


### Exporting as Scene Files

You can also export your game as individual scene files, either as a backup, as a play-test version for your beta testers, or as a completed game for submission to Choice of Games LLC when looking to publish.

To export your scenes, right-click the Project header bar and select 'Export: All Scenes To Folder'. You will be prompted to select a save location for your scenes in an existing or newly-created folder.

Scene files can be uploaded to Dashingdon's free ChoiceScript game hosting service to create a public beta test of your game online (see below for details).


### Public Beta Testing - Dashingdon.com

When you're ready to share your game during the beta testing process, [Dashingdon](https://forum.choiceofgames.com/u/dashingdon/ "Dashingdon's ChoiceScript Profile") offers free hosting for your game, either as a compiled .html game or as a collection of scenes. Dashingdon.com also supports images, automatic Twitter announcements when your game beta is updated, and more.
