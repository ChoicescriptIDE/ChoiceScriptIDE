To celebrate the imminent release of the ChoiceScript IDE we'll be hosting a Pre-Launch livestream event on the 18th of September.
This session will give you a chance to see CSIDE in action ahead of time and decide if it could make a difference to how you develop your interactive fiction (or get you interested in the first place!).

You'll have a chance to see a variety of its features in action alongside a Q&A with the designers and developer and a start to finish 'bare bones project' workshop.

Bring all your questions, eagerness and curiosity - we hope to see you there!
