Hello everyone, it's been a while!

First off, an update: **CSIDE is coming**, you can rest assured on that, and there will be more news about it soon enough.

For now, please accept my formal apology for the massive hype and buildup created in its name over the late holiday period. Let it suffice to say that I had every intention of committing to that release, but found myself torn between that commitment and one to deliver to you an application that is 100% worth the (increasingly) long wait. I believe I made the right decision, and only hope that you will be inclined to agree, once CSIDE is finally in your hands.

Now to the main point of this post... In the run-up to the release of CSIDE (the culmination of a four-year long journey), I wanted to reflect back to where and how it all began. The original idea, as many of you may know, came from a very simple desire: To be able to quickly and easily run snippets of ChoiceScript code posted on the Choice of Games forum. The result was the online ChoiceScript tester. A simple thing, that served a simple purpose.

After the unexpected interest in the tester, I expanded on the idea, and created the original ChoiceScript 'IDE', which was my first foray into creating something that would not only let you test your ChoiceScript games, but would also help you develop them. Cutting a long story short, CSIDE as it is today, could not exist without the lessons learnt through the development of these predecessors, and the interest and support they received from the ChoiceScript community.

I would like to announce that these legacy tools can now once again be accessed via this website, in their original state. They have been uploaded 'as-is', and will not be benefiting from any future updates, bug-fixes or new versions of ChoiceScript. They have been uploaded purely in the name of fun and nostalgia, but I upload them in the hope that they may yet prove useful, entertaining or informative.

We will have more news for you very soon.
