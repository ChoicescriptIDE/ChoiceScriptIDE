bio: Hi, I'm CJW, and I design and develop the ChoiceScript IDE. I have been using ChoiceScript for five years, and developing the current iteration of CSIDE for three (2017). I have little to my name in the way of authorships, but have founded an interest and passion for providing technical help and support to other aspiring authors. <br><br>My professional background is in computer science and web development, and my Choice of hobbies stemmed from an unhealthy and cliche obsession with fantasy (and science fiction) books and video games.
