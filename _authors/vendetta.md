bio: "Bob Middleton here, a.k.a. Vendetta, Co-Founder and Editor of the ChoiceScriptDev Wiki and—perhaps even more infamously—author of what is probably the longest-running on-off WIP saga in CS history, Vendetta: Rise of a Gangster.<br><br>With a professional background in systems and strategy game design stretching back more years than I usually care to remember, I've been involved with CSIDE since the early days and secretly pat myself on the back for inspiring some of its many useful features and functions. Then again, I've also been known to see flying pink elephants from time to time (don't ask).<br><br>My love of CSIDE is such that I felt compelled to pay homage to its brilliance in the form of a 23k-word Interactive Tutorial: Learning Basic ChoiceScript, to help newcomers to CS—and new CSIDE users in general—ease into things. I would very much welcome your questions and feedback to help me fine-tune the Tutorial for future new users."
