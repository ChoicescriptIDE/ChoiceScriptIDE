name: Fiogan
bio: I'm Fiogan, editor and writer of interactive fiction. To date, I've edited for two published Hosted Games authors. I also have a handful of my own CS games underway, including The Beastie Watch, winner of the Fourth Annual CS Comp.<br><br>I enjoy new adventures; when I found Choice of Games and realised I could combine my love of reading and SFF with my love of active exploration, I was hooked. I've been writing with CSIDE since my first WiP and serve as editor for the documentation; please feel free to contact me with any questions!
