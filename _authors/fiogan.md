name: Fiogan
bio: I'm Fiogan, editor and writer of interactive fiction. To date, I've edited for two published Hosted Games authors. As a writer, I have a handful of WiPs underway including The Beastie Watch, winner of the Fourth Annual CS Comp. <br><br>I've lived on three different continents, and my professional hats include relief worker, classical pianist, florist, and secretary. I enjoy new adventures; when I found Choice of Games and realised I could combine my love of reading and SFF with my love of active exploration, I was hooked.<br><br>I've been using CSIDE since my first WiP, and I also serve as editor for documentation. Please feel free to contact me with any questions about using and enjoying CSIDE!
